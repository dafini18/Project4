# Project4
This project is to analyze rental properties in a certain area and provide insights into rental prices and property features. The project will involve scraping data from online listings using web scraping libraries such as Beautiful Soup or Scrapy and storing the data in a Pandas DataFrame. The data frame will include information such as the property's link, rental price, title, address, type, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, parking spots, utilities, whether it is furnished, size, whether it is air-conditioned, and whether pets are allowed. The project will involve cleaning the data and conducting exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in rental prices and property features. For example, we may look at the distribution of rental prices, the most common property types, the relationship between rental prices and property size, and the popularity of certain amenities such as air conditioning or allowing pets. Additionally, the project may involve building predictive models to estimate rental prices based on certain property features. This could involve using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression or random forests. Overall, this project aims to provide insights and value to individuals or companies interested in the rental property market by using web scraping, data analysis, and predictive modeling techniques in Python.
